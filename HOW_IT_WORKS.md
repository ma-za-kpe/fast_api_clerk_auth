## User Type Enforcement Flow

### How The System Knows Who Can Do What:

1. **During Sign Up:**
   - User selects their type (client/developer/manager)
   - System creates UserTypeProfile record
   - Type stored in database

2. **During Sign In:**
   ```json
   POST /api/v1/auth/signin
   Response includes:
   {
     "user": {
       "id": "user_123",
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "user_type": "client"  // ‚Üê Frontend uses this
     }
   }
   ```

3. **On Every Request:**
   - Frontend includes Bearer token
   - Backend validates token
   - Backend checks user_type from database
   - Enforces access control

4. **Access Control Examples:**

   | Endpoint | Client | Developer | Delivery Manager | Engineering Manager | Tech Lead | QA Lead | Admin |
   |----------|--------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|--------|
   | Create Company | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
   | Create Project | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
   | Bid on Project | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
   | Vet Developer | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
   | Approve Milestone | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
   | Technical Approval | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
   | Quality Approval | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
   | User Management | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
   | Platform Analytics | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

---

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Initial Authentication
```javascript
// Frontend
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/auth/signin', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ clerk_token: clerkSessionToken })
});

const data = await response.json();
// data.user.user_type tells frontend what UI to show
```

### 2. Frontend Routing Based on User Type
```javascript
switch(user.user_type) {
  case 'client':
    redirect('/client-dashboard');
    break;
  case 'developer':
    redirect('/developer-dashboard');
    break;
  case 'delivery_manager':
    redirect('/projects/manage');
    break;
}
```

### 3. Backend Enforcement
```python
# Company creation endpoint
async def create_company(user_id: str, ...):
    # This will throw error if user is not CLIENT type
    await user_type_service.verify_user_type(db, user_id, UserType.CLIENT)
    # Only proceeds if user is CLIENT
    company = await company_service.create_company(...)
```

## Database Structure

### User Type Tracking:
```sql
-- Every user has exactly one type
user_type_profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_id (unique)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_type (client/developer/manager)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verified_at (when approved)

-- Clients have companies
companies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ owner_id (links to user)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ company details...

-- Developers have profiles
developer_profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_id (links to user)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vetting_status (pending/approved/rejected)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ professional details...
```

---

## API Response Examples

### Sign In Response (Shows User Type):
```json
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_123",
    "email": "john@company.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "user_type": "client"  // ‚Üê Frontend uses this to show correct UI
  }
}
```

### GET /api/v1/auth/me Response:
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "email": "jane@email.com",
  "user_type": "developer",  // ‚Üê Determines available actions
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Smith"
}
```

---

## Error Handling

### When Wrong User Type Tries Restricted Action:
```json
// Developer tries to create company
POST /api/v1/clients/company
Response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "detail": "This action requires client access"
}
```

### When Developer Not Vetted Yet:
```json
// Pending developer tries to bid
POST /api/v1/projects/123/bid
Response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "detail": "Your profile must be approved before bidding"
}
```

---

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Test Client Flow:
```bash
# Sign up as client
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"client@test.com", "password":"Test123!", "user_type":"client"}'

# Create company (with auth token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/clients/company \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Company", "size_id":1}'
```

### 2. Test Developer Flow:
```bash
# Sign up as developer
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"dev@test.com", "password":"Test123!", "user_type":"developer"}'

# Try to create company (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/clients/company \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DEV_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Company"}'
# Response: 403 Forbidden - "This action requires client access"
```

## Summary

The platform ensures proper access control through:

1. **User Type Assignment at Signup** - Each user declares their role
2. **Database Tracking** - UserTypeProfile table maintains user types
3. **API Response Inclusion** - All auth endpoints return user_type
4. **Backend Enforcement** - Services verify user type before actions
5. **Frontend Routing** - UI adapts based on user_type

This creates a secure, role-based system where:
- **Clients** can only create companies and projects
- **Developers** can only create developer profiles and bid
- **Managers** have their specific oversight capabilities
- **Everyone** stays in their lane, ensuring platform integrity
