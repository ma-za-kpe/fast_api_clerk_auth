â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useUser.ts
â””â”€â”€ types/
    â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

### API Integration Pattern

```typescript
// API call example
const api = useApi();

// Sync with backend after Clerk auth
const syncUser = await api.auth.signIn(clerkToken);

// Get user type for routing
const userType = syncUser.user_type;

// Route to appropriate dashboard
router.push(`/${userType}/dashboard`);
```

### Component Hierarchy

1. **Layout Components**
   - RootLayout (with ClerkProvider)
   - PlatformLayout (with navigation)
   - DashboardLayout (role-specific)

2. **Page Components**
   - Authentication pages
   - Dashboard pages (per user type)
   - CRUD pages (projects, profiles, etc.)

3. **Feature Components**
   - Forms (ProjectForm, ProfileForm)
   - Lists (ProjectList, DeveloperList)
   - Cards (ProjectCard, DeveloperCard)
   - Modals (BidModal, ReviewModal)

## API Endpoints Mapping

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/signup` - Register new user
- `POST /auth/signin` - Sync Clerk token with backend
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info

### Client Operations
- `POST /clients/company` - Create company
- `GET /clients/company` - Get company details
- `PUT /clients/company` - Update company

### Developer Operations
- `POST /developers/profile` - Create profile
- `GET /developers/profile` - Get profile
- `PUT /developers/profile` - Update profile
- `GET /developers/pending-vetting` - For managers

### Project Management
- `POST /projects` - Create project
- `GET /projects` - List projects
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Get project details
- `POST /projects/{id}/bid` - Submit bid
- `GET /projects/{id}/bids` - List bids

### Reference Data
- `GET /reference/*` - Public lookups
- `GET /admin/reference/*` - Admin management

## State Management

### User State
```typescript
interface UserState {
  clerkUser: ClerkUser | null;
  backendUser: BackendUser | null;
  userType: UserType;
  company?: Company;
  developerProfile?: DeveloperProfile;
  permissions: Permission[];
}
```

### Project State
```typescript
interface ProjectState {
  projects: Project[];
  currentProject: Project | null;
  bids: Bid[];
  milestones: Milestone[];
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Clerk handles primary authentication
   - Backend validates Clerk tokens
   - User type stored in backend, not frontend

2. **Authorization**
   - Middleware checks user type
   - API endpoints enforce permissions
   - UI conditionally renders based on role

3. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data never in localStorage
   - API calls always authenticated
   - CORS configured for security

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Component testing
   - Hook testing
   - Utility function testing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - API integration
   - Auth flow
   - User journeys

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Complete user flows
   - Role-based access
   - Error handling

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Clerk project set up
- [ ] API endpoint verified
- [ ] Build optimization
- [ ] Error tracking setup
- [ ] Analytics configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security headers
- [ ] CORS policy
- [ ] Rate limiting

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Runs on http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **API Connection**
   - Ensure inception-api running on port 8000
   - Check CORS settings
   - Verify Clerk configuration

3. **Testing User Types**
   - Create test accounts for each role
   - Test complete user journeys
   - Verify permission enforcement

## Next Steps

1. Create API client layer with type safety
2. Build authentication pages with user type selection
3. Implement role-based dashboards
4. Add CRUD operations for each entity
5. Test complete user workflows
6. Optimize performance
7. Deploy to production
